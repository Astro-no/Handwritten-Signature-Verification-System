# Handwritten-Signature-Verification-System
The use case was a library management system.

A Mozilla Grant funded this project to the Computer Security and Forensics Team of Meru University of Science and Technology.

We developed a handwritten signature verification system that could be used in a library like the Reuben Marambii Library of Meru University of Science and Technology.
It was built using Python programming language, HTML, PHP, and some CSS.

Without much ado, let's get into it.
